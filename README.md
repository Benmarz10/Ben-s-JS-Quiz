# JS-Quiz
This is a web app containing a javascript quiz.
# Decription
This quiz is timed and will subtract time for incorrectly answered questions. The scores are added to local storage and will be shown at the end of quiz after you save your name.
# Usage
When the user clicks "Start" they will be prompted with 4 questions to answer in 25 seconds. Each incorrectly answered question will then subtract 5 seconds from allowed time. Once the timer reaches 0 the user will then be prompted to save their name so that the highscore can be kept in local storage. The user will then be able to play again for a chance to beat their score.
